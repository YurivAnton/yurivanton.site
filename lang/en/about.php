    'me' => 'Hi! My name is Anton, and I’m a web developer with over four years of self-taught experience and hands-on practice. For me, programming is more than just a profession — it’s a way of thinking and a tool to build meaningful things.

                My main focus is backend development using PHP, Laravel, and JavaScript for the frontend side. I care deeply about code quality, project structure, and building solutions that are not only functional but also clean, flexible, and scalable.

                I work on personal projects every day — learning new techniques, improving my skills, and exploring better ways to solve problems. I built this website myself, from the database structure to the finest details in layout. It’s not just a portfolio — it’s a reflection of how I work.

                I value clarity, logic, and well-thought-out solutions. I’m always open to new challenges, meeting like-minded people, and working on exciting projects. If you’re looking for a developer who puts care and responsibility into their work — I’d be happy to connect!',
    'my_goals' => 'I dream of becoming a part of a development team where I can apply my skills, grow alongside experienced developers, and contribute to real-world projects.

                It is important to me not just to write code, but to understand how my work impacts users and helps a business thrive. I want to keep growing as a developer, dive deeper into application architecture, and explore modern tools and technologies.

                My goal is to become a valuable team member — someone who’s not afraid of challenges and always eager to learn.',
